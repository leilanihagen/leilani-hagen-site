        <h2>Future of Code</h2>
        <h3>Teaching Kids to Code</h3>
        <p>Future of Code is a volunteer-based organization that
        provides code-literacy education to kids in Vancouver, Washington.
        Students are typically aged 7-13 and come from all backgrounds. The
        education provided by Future of Code is completely free of charge to
        families.</p>
        <p><br></br>Future of Code is run by a group of passionate volunteers who
        have backgrounds in teaching, tech, or both! FOC's classes and clubs are
        extremely beneficial to their students, and always a lot of fun! Learning
        to code at a young age is an effective way to learn to think logically
        and critically because such ways of thinking are the language of coding.
        When the bug in your program is staring you in the face, the only path to
        success is learning to think like a computer, the logical machine. Yet,
        at the same time, kids barely notice the hard thinking they're doing
        because they're having too much fun creatively designing their own games
        and programs. Developing these fundamental thinking skills at a young age
        is beneficial for any childs development; and learning to code is always
        beneficial for a kids future resume!</p>
        <p><br></br>Please check out Future of Code's
          <a href="http://futureofcode.org/">website</a>
        to paritipate in e-learning during the coronavirus pandemic (and live
        classes again as soon as it is safe!).<br></br> </p>
        <h3>My Involvment</h3>
        <p>I volunteered for Future of Code for 2 years from January 2018 until
          February 2020 when I took a break due to my traveling to Norway. I have
          helped instruct several 8-week classes, co-taught one such class, and
          ran an ongoing weekly club for a few months. I hope to be involved with
          FOC again in the near future.</p>
